             <h2>Cluttered Desks of the Early 2000s</h2>
             
             <p>Between the year 2000 and today, the typical IT workspace <br>
                has transformed significantly, reflecting rapid <br>
                advancements in technology. At the turn of the millennium,<br>
                office desks were often cluttered with bulky CRT<br>
                monitors, large desktop towers, wired keyboards, and<br>
                and landline phones with long cords were the<br>
                standard for business communication. Computers<br>
                 of that era were far less powerful.</p>

             <h2>Smarter, Sleeker Workspaces of Today</h2>
             
             <p>Today’s IT desks are much sleeker and more efficient <br>
                thanks to the evolution of smart technology. Old CRT <br>
                monitors and towers have been replaced by slim laptops, <br>
                high-resolution flat screens, or even all-in-one smart<br>
                computers with powerful processors and minimal footprint. <br>
                Fax machines have all but disappeared, replaced by email,<br>
                loud sharing, and instant messaging platforms that transmit <br>
                documents faster and more securely. Similarly, traditional<br>
                office phones have been replaced or supplemented by<br>
                smartphones and VoIP solutions, making communication <br>
                seamless and mobile. </p>
